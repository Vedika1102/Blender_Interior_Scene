# 🛋️ Stylized Interior Room | Blender 3D Modeling Project

A fully stylized 3D interior scene created using **Blender**, designed to highlight visual storytelling through clean topology, simple forms, and vibrant materials. This project showcases my skills in hard-surface modeling, modular layout design, lighting techniques, and rendering optimization in Blender.

## 🔍 Project Description

This project represents a compact, cozy bedroom space modeled from scratch to practice stylized proportions, color balance, and object placement. The goal was to create a visually pleasing composition using minimalist geometry while maintaining clarity and detail in form.

Key elements include:
- A custom **bedframe with cushions and mattress**
- Wall-mounted **photo frames with emissive image planes**
- A floating **shelf**
- **Layered flooring** and stylized wall blocks
- Thoughtful **lighting setup** for soft shadows and mood

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated

### 🧱 3D Modeling
- Constructed all assets from primitive meshes using modifiers such as **Bevel**, **Subdivision Surface**, and **Mirror**.
- Maintained **clean topology** with quads for efficient rendering and future editability.
- Designed **modular walls and platforms** for scalable layout.

### 🎨 Materials & Shading
- Used **Principled BSDF** shaders for a stylized plastic-like aesthetic.
- Created **contrasting color palettes** for better visual separation of elements.
- Configured roughness and specular values to mimic soft matte surfaces.

### 💡 Lighting & Rendering
- Employed a **3-point lighting setup** with an HDRi gradient background.
- Used **Area and Point Lights** to simulate realistic indoor lighting with control over softness and directionality.
- Rendered using **Cycles Renderer** with samples tuned for clarity and noise reduction.

### 🗂️ Scene Organization
- Grouped objects into collections (`Bed`, `Wall`, `Decor`, `Lighting`) for easy navigation.
- Used **naming conventions** and layered outliner management.
- Scaled scene to real-world units (meters) for export-readiness.

🔍 How to View the Models
- Clone or Download this repository to your local machine.

- Open the .blend file using Blender 2.9 or later (recommended: 3.0+ for optimal compatibility).

- Explore the scene in the 3D Viewport — all objects are organized and grouped for easy navigation.

- Check out the rendered output in the assets/CozyRoom.png file to see the final result.

For interactive use:

- Tweak the camera angles, lighting, or materials.

- Use F12 to re-render and experiment with your own visual styles.
